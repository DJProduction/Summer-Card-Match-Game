* Users will also loose stars depending on the number of moves.

## Tips

* Be cautious of the changing backgrounds, the hotter the background the closer low star ratings you get.
* If you choose to restart all the positions of the cards from the previous game change.
* Take your time, stay cool, and have fun!
